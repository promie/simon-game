# Simon Game
Free Code Camp Advanced Project.
This is officially the hardest project for FreeCodeCamp. The logic in getting the correct sequence was the most challenging part. I've spent three days just redesigning the logic for this app.

I am glad I was able to pull through and receive the Free Code Camp Front End Certification.

### About the App
Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, with software programming by Lenny Cope. The game creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the series. If the user succeeds the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails, the game is over.
